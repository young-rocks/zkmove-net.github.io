<div class="main-explain-area jumbotron">
    <p><b>A zero-knowledge Move language virtual machine</b>. As a new generation of programming language for smart contract, Move ensures programming safety using its type checking, borrow checking and ownership mechanism. zkMove is bytecode-compatible with Move and inherits the safety of Move.</p>
    <p><b>Application-specifc and Turing-complete</b>. zkMove circuit is built based on the Halo2 proof system and is a general-purpose VM circuit. Unlike common VM circuit, zkMove circuit is application-specific. It has smaller circuit size and shorter proving time.</p>
    <p><b>Scaling and privacy solution rolled into one</b>. Based on zkMove, we will provide a safe and efficient zk rollup solution. We are also exploring adding more privacy properties to the solution.</p>
